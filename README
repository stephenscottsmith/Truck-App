I have added a new mock database for the Block Party as well as a mock database for users once I get the login screen working. 

I have also revised the number and placement of buttons on the TruckDetailController, and it will be replicated in the BlockPartyDetailController as well. I want fewer buttons for now. If we want to add more we can always apply an update. 

Hopefully by this Thursday I will have successfully implemented:

-Block Party Detail Views just like the Truck Detail Views

-A login view that utilizes the user database

-A way of displaying certain tabs for different types of users (i.e. people vs. truck owners)
